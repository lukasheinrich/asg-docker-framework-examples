	* BTaggingEfficiencyTool: remove constraints on non-b-tagging related variations in applySystematicVariation()
	* tester code: update to October 2015 CDI file (using different naming convention for tagger operating points)
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-26

	* test destructor in BTaggingEfficiencyToolTester code

2015-08-27 Frank Filthaut <F.Filthaut@science.ru.nl>
	* BTaggingSelectionTool: build in extra protection against null BTagging object
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-21

2015-08-10 Frank Filthaut <F.Filthaut@science.ru.nl>
	* BTaggingEfficiencyTool modifications:
	  - allow for "continuous tagging" use of other MVA taggers than MV1
	  - bug fix for "extrapolation from charm" uncertainty (NB this also needs CalibrationDataInterface-00-05-09 or newer):
	    o  in the SFEigen model this wasn't indexed correctly, meaning that the effective uncertainty returned was always 0
	    o  in the Envelope model it wasn't implemented properly, causing code to fail
	  - add "FT_EFF_" prefixes for the uncertainties generally encountered in either the SFEigen or Envelope model
	    (user-specified named uncertainties are not touched by this)
	* remove testCDI.root (no longer needed) and the spurious .env file (never used by this package)
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-20

2015-07-30 Frank Filthaut <F.Filthaut@science.ru.nl>
	* add printout messages in case of error returns of main methods
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-19

2015-07-17 Christian Luedtke <cluedtke@cern.ch>, Michael Ughetto <mughetto@cern.ch>, Valerio Dao <vdao@cern.ch>
	* add first version of BTaggingSelectionTool
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-18

2015-07-03 Frank Filthaut <F.Filthaut@science.ru.nl>
	* add other BTaggingEfficiencyTool public methods also as part of the IBTaggingEfficiencyTool interface (on request of TopAnalysis etc.)
	* remove leading/trailing whitespace from property strings
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-17

2015-05-20 Frank Filthaut <F.Filthaut@science.ru.nl>
	* change BTaggingEfficiencyToolTester code to use the new pre-recommendations file (on CVMFS) and MV2c20 tagger
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-16

2015-05-20 Frank Filthaut <F.Filthaut@science.ru.nl>
	* implement (steering of) eigenvector variation reduction
	* implement use of exclusive hadron / cone based labelling, and make it default
	* tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-15

2015-02-11 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Disabled the generation of some additional dictionaries with
	  ROOT 6 to get rid of some runtime warnings in
	  AnalysisBase-2.1.X.
	* Tagging as xAODBTaggingEfficiency-00-00-14
